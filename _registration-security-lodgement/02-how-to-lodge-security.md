# How to Lodge Security 

You can lodge the security in the form of a Banker’s Guarantee, Finance Company Guarantee or an Insurance Bond.

Download the  [Security Application Form](/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links)  and bring it to your bank, finance company or insurance company for lodgement of the Banker's Guarantee/Finance Company Guarantee/Insurance Bond

## Further points to note:

-   Except for securities that are lodged for an ad-hoc basis (e.g. temporary importation of an ad-hoc shipment), the security lodged should be valid for at least one year, with the expiry date set to 31 December of the following year.
-   The bank, finance company or insurance company must be registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).
-   The insurance company must be a Direct Insurer (General) or Direct Insurer (Composite) listed under [MAS’s Financial Institutions Directory](https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid){:target="_blank"}.
