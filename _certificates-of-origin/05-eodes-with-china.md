# Electronic Origin Data Exchange System (EODES) with China

Under the auspice of the upgraded China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, Singapore Customs and GACC had agreed to establish an Electronic Origin Data Exchange System (EODES) to allow the electronic exchange of PCO between Singapore and China. This eliminates the need for hardcopy Preferential Certificate of Origin (PCO) to be despatched overseas, enabling companies to enjoy savings in cost and time.For more information on how you may benefit from EODES, you may wish to download the [handbook](/documents/businesses/EODES%20handbook%20June%202020.pdf). 

With effect from 1 May 2020, China has implemented full electronic transmission of PCO. Therefore, to benefit from the seamless clearance of the goods that exporters and their appointed declaring agents/freight forwarders will enjoy, it would be best to leverage on the International Connectivity PCO (IC PCO) service on Networked Trade Platform (NTP). Furthermore, apart from exporters, Importers who wish to claim preferential treatment for import of goods from China to Singapore or to apply for a back-to-back PCO would be able to retrieve the electronic PCO issued by China via the ICPCO service. For more information on how you could sign up for the IC PCO service, please refer to [Notice 18/2019](/news-and-media/notices/2019-10-15-N.pdf) under News and Media > Notices.
