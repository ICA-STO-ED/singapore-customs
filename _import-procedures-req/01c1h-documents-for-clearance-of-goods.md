# Documents for Clearance of Goods

**Documents Required for Containerised Cargo**

You should ensure the validity of the customs permit presented for clearance of your imports.

For containerised cargo, the container number and shipper seal number must be declared when applying for the customs permit.

**Importing by sea:** You are **not required** to present the customs permit and supporting documents to the checkpoint officers at the entry points.

**Importing by air or land:** You are **required** to produce the printed copy of the customs permit, and supporting documents such as invoice, packing list and Air Waybill/consignment note, to the checkpoint officers at the time of cargo clearance for verification:

An example of conditions in the customs permit indicating this requirement:

|  |  |
|--|--|
| **A1** |The goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance/ endorsement at a Free Trade Zone "In" Gate.|
|**A3**| The goods must be produced with this permit, invoices, BL/AWB, etc for Customs endorsement at an Airport Customs checkpoint or designated Customs office or station as required.|
|**H1**| The goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance / endorsement at Woodlands Checkpoint / Tuas Checkpoint.|

# Documents Required for Conventional Cargo & Hand-Carried Goods

For conventional cargo and hand-carried goods, you should present the goods, printed copy of the customs permit, and supporting documents such as invoice, packing list and Bill of Lading/Air Waybill, to the checkpoint officers at the entry points for verification.

An example of conditions in the customs permit indicating this requirement:

|  |  |
|--|--|
| **A1** |The goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance/ endorsement at a Free Trade Zone "In" Gate.

For a consignment which requires **partial clearance**, the same customs permit should be presented each time for endorsement till the whole consignment is completely cleared.

**Please note partial clearance is not allowed for goods brought in via Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints.**
