# Travellers’ Satisfaction Survey Results

The Travellers’ Satisfaction Survey is conducted periodically to measure travellers’ perceptions of customs services at the checkpoints, and to identify gaps between travellers’ expectations and actual levels of service experienced.

From the survey, Singapore Customs seeks to determine the specific service needs and expectations of travellers and suggestions for improvements.

We thank all respondents who had spent their valuable time to provide us with their feedback.
