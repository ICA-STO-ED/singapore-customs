# STOP Illegal Cigarettes! 

### About the Campaign

Our campaign, “STOP Illegal Cigarettes!”, aims to raise greater awareness among members of public and to strengthen vigilance among vulnerable groups to fight against illegal cigarettes activities.   

Through a series of mini-roadshows, Customs has shared with stakeholders the perils and consequences of getting involved with illegal cigarettes activities and get their support to tip-off Customs on such activities.

### Between 2017 – 2019, Singapore Customs conducted close to 500 outreach sessions to over 30,000 people. Learn about our outreach sessions against illegal cigarettes activities:

*Garnering Community Support to STOP Illegal Cigarettes!* <br>
The community-at-large is our “eyes-and-ears” who play an important role to help detect illegal cigarettes activities and make our homes a safer place to live in. Recognising the importance which the community can help to deter crimes, Singapore Customs has partnered with other government agencies (e.g. Singapore Police Force and the People’s Association) to organise joint roadshows at heartland neighbourhoods to share messages with residents on anti-illegal cigarettes and avenues to tip-off Customs if they spotted any illegal cigarettes activities within the community.

*Raising Migrant Workers’ Awareness to Stay Away from Crimes* <br> 
As the migrant workers population is large and many of them are new to Singapore, there is a need to educate them of Customs’ laws and regulations for greater compliance. Customs has worked with companies and partnered with government agencies and non-government organisations (e.g. Migrant Workers’ Centre) to reach out to these migrant workers through joint roadshows and awareness talks on “STOP Illegal Cigarettes!”. Through these targeted outreach efforts, migrant workers were able to better understand the required laws, the consequences for non-compliance as well as various avenues to tip-off Customs if they spotted any illegal cigarettes activities.
