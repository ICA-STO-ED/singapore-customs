# Our International Participation

**ASEAN Customs Procedures and Trade Facilitation Working Group (CPTFWG)**<br>
Singapore Customs currently chairs the Customs Procedures and Trade Facilitation Working Group (CPTFWG), which is established to implement the Strategic Plans of Customs Development (SPCDs) at both the regional and national level. The CPTFWG also aims to enhance partnership with businesses and economic operators to secure the international supply chain and create a business-friendly environment for legitimate trade to flow. 

**Sub-Working Group on ASEAN Customs Transit System (SWG-ACTS)**<br>
Singapore Customs currently chairs the Sub-Working Group on ASEAN Customs Transit System (SWG-ACTS), which works on the implementation of the ACTS. Guided by the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods in Transit (AFAFGIT) and its protocols, the ACTS is a computerised Customs transit management system, owned by ASEAN, to facilitate goods movement through ASEAN under a single transit regime. The ACTS allows each ASEAN Member State (AMS) to capture and track the status and movement of the goods.

Additional information on the ACTS can be found at [https://acts.asean.org](https://acts.asean.org){:target="_blank"}

**Sub-Working Group on ASEAN Authorised Economic Operator Mutual Recognition Arrangement (SWG-AAMRA)**<br>
Singapore Customs currently chairs the Sub-working Group on ASEAN Authorised Economic Operator Mutual Recognition Arrangement (SWG-AAMRA). The SWG-AAMRA works on a pathfinder approach to implement an ASEAN Authorised Economic Operator – Mutual Recognition Arrangement (AEO-MRA)  with AMS ASEAN member states who have implemented their national AEO programmes. In line with the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint 2025 to achieve a highly integrated and cohesive ASEAN economy, a regional ASEAN AEO-MRA could potentially enhance trade and promote economic growth in ASEAN by reducing regulatory burden on international trade and facilitating the movement of goods within ASEAN. 

**ASEAN Single Window Steering Committee (ASWSC)**<br>
Singapore Customs currently chairs the ASEAN Single Window Steering Committee (ASWSC), which manages the development of the ASEAN Single Window (ASW). The ASW is a regional initiative that connects and integrates National Single Windows (NSW) of AMS. The ASW’s objective is to expedite cargo clearance and promote ASEAN economic integration by enabling the electronic exchange of border trade-related documents among AMS.
